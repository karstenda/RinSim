\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


This paper will outline a \textit{Delegate Multi Agents System (DMAS)} that uses \textit{Ant Colony Optimalisation (ACO)} to solve the dynamic \textit{Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP)}. The performance of this DMAS will be compared with two other classic \textit{Multi Agent Systems (MAS)}, \textit{ContractNet} and \textit{Gradient Field}.
\\
\\
It is assumed in the dynamic PDP that a truck can only transport one package at the time and that new packages can randomly be added to the system. The infrastructure will also remain the same and no congestion is possible.
\\
\\
The reader is supposed to have a decent knowledge of \textit{Multi Agent Systems (MAS)} and the applications of \textit{Ant Colony Optimalisation (ACO)} in \textit{Delegate Multi Agent Systems (DMAS)}.
